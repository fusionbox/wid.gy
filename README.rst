demo.wid.gy
-----------

This is the codebase for the demo.wid.gy website.  It is mostly powered by the
demo project that lives inside the django-widgy repository.


In order to be able to use the code that lives in that demo project, we have to
install widgy from the repository and not directly off of PyPI.
